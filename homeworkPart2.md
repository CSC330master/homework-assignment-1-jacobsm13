i. You are encouraged to work on homework assignments in pairs unless otherwise specified, but you also have the choice to work on them alone. If you choose to work in a pair, both students will receive the same grade. You can discuss your ideas with classmates outside of your group. However, do not do your homework with individuals outside of your group.
ii. You can consult any available resources (printed or online) when doing homework assignments. Always read and understand the material you find. Then put it aside and start writing your own answer. You can discuss ideas with classmates outside of your group but do not do your homework with individuals outside of your group. You are welcome to use concepts that were not covered in class, but you must be able to explain your solution and show understanding of the concepts you used. Include your sources (and the names of fellow students with whom you brainstormed) as a separate document, to be submitted with each assignment. If you have not collaborated with anyone, then the document should include the statement, "I did not collaborate with anyone while working on this assignment." If you have not consulted any external resources the the document should include, "I did not consult any sources other than the textbook while working on this assignment."
iii. There is a penalty of 15% per day for submitting late assignments.
iv. If you join class more than 10 minutes late or leave class early, you are considered absent. You are allowed 2 unexcused absences with no penalty. Additional absences or failure to complete the exit ticket results in a penalty of 15% of the participation grade.
